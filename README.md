👋 Hi, I’m @paradiseinmountain

    👀 I’m interested in promoting nature exploration, hiking, local wildlife, and sustainability around the Moradal mountain range.
    🌱 I’m currently learning about ecological construction using materials from the mountain, as well as developing smart house and farm systems using ESP32 and AI to manage agriculture, communal spaces, and cabins.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on outdoor adventure projects, eco-tourism, environmental conservation, and smart systems for sustainable living.
